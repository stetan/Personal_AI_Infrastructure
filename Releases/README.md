# LifeOS Releases

</div>

## What Are Releases?

LifeOS ships as a **single self-contained skill** — your AI installs it for you. Each release is a versioned snapshot of that skill. There's no `~/.claude/` directory to copy; installing the skill *is* the install.

**About the older releases.** LifeOS began as **PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure)**, and back then it shipped as a `~/.claude/` directory you installed into your home folder. Releases **v2.3–v5.0.0** are that era — kept here for history, not for new installs. **v6.0.0** is the first skill-based release and the current model. Same system, same lineage — just no longer a `.claude/` directory.

## Available Releases

### v6.0.0 — The Life Operating System (Current)

LifeOS ships as a single self-contained skill, not a `.claude/` copy — the full framework installs through your AI.

- Algorithm v6.23.0
- Two-tier core components: Current→Ideal, the Algorithm, Skills, Hooks, Router, Pulse, custom spinner verbs, and custom tooltips, plus the supporting subsystems (Memory, Agents, Voice, Learning, Security)
- Skill-only distribution via the LifeOS install skill
- Full Pulse Life Dashboard + menu bar app

**[Get v6.0.0 →](v6.0.0/)**

## Legacy Releases (`.claude/`-era)

These predate the skill model — they shipped as `~/.claude/` directories. Kept for history; **not** the current install path.

### v5.0.0 — Life Operating System

The release that reframed the whole system as a Life Operating System built around the move from current state to ideal state.

### v4.0.3 — Community PR Patch

4 community-contributed fixes from open PRs.

- Inference: JSON parsing now handles arrays `[]` alongside objects `{}`
- Documentation: removed 29 dead references from CONTEXT_ROUTING.md
- Portability: WorldThreatModelHarness uses `$PAI_DIR` instead of hardcoded path
- Installer: migrates user context from v2.5/v3.0 paths on upgrade

**[Get v4.0.3 →](v4.0.3/)**

### v4.0.2 — Bug Fix Patch

13 surgical fixes — no new features, no breaking changes.

- Linux compatibility: cross-platform OAuth token extraction, GNU coreutils `tr` fix
- Installer: correct alias path, shell detection (bash/fish/zsh), headless CLI fallback
- Statusline: width cache, algorithmVersion field, cross-platform OAuth
- Hooks: inference guard (~15s savings), lineage tracking, dead code removal, exit codes, voice config

### v4.0.1 — Upgrade Path & Preferences

Patch release addressing community feedback on upgrade difficulties and missing preferences.

- Upgrade path documentation with backup, merge, and post-upgrade checklist

## Installation

LifeOS installs as a skill — give it to your AI. Paste this into any capable harness (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, …):

> **Read https://ourlifeos.ai/install and install LifeOS for me.**

Or the one-line shortcut for Claude Code on macOS/Linux:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ourlifeos.ai/install.sh | bash
```

The install asks for your name, AI name, timezone, temperature unit, and optional voice preferences.

**Legacy releases (v2–v5)** installed the old way — as a `~/.claude/` directory with their own `install.sh`. That's no longer how LifeOS works; if you specifically need an old version, follow that release's own README. New installs use the skill above.

See the [main README](../README.md) for more.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Install didn't take?** Re-run it — just ask your AI to install LifeOS again from [ourlifeos.ai/install](https://ourlifeos.ai/install).

**Hooks not firing?** Restart your harness after installation.

**Questions?** See the main [LifeOS README](../README.md).
